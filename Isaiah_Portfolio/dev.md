# Developer notes :D

## About
This is where I'll store notes about the development process for Me and my AI Buddy!

## About my skills
I'm a developer specializing in Full Stack Development with various tools (my personal favorite being my FSH (fish) stack consisting of FastApi / Flask, SQL and HTMX), and in automation with Python and Bash scripts. I take joy in teaching students of varying ages about programming, and have a healthy bias towards Python as my programming language of choice!
